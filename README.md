# YouTube Clone

A simple static **YouTube clone** built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. This project is focused on exploring and practicing fundamental front-end development concepts, including **HTML5 semantic elements**, **CSS positioning**, **Flexbox**, **Grid Layout**, and other core layout and styling techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Clean and responsive layout mimicking YouTube's front page
- Use of semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and structure
- CSS Flexbox for flexible, responsive layouts
- CSS Grid for advanced two-dimensional layouts
- Custom header, sidebar, and video card components
- Hover effects and consistent spacing
- No JavaScript — entirely static

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Layouts with Flexbox and Grid, visual styling, and responsiveness

## 📚 What I Learned

- Structuring HTML using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- Using CSS Flexbox to align and distribute space in a one-dimensional layout
- Using CSS Grid to design complex two-dimensional layouts
- Applying `position` properties (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`)
- Creating a responsive UI without JavaScript
